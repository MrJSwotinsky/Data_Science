## Part 2 - Lab

In this lab, you will practice selecting rows in a DataFrame.  

1.  Create a new Jupyter Notebook file in your Physical Device > Data Science Portfolio > Labs folder titled `LastNameFirstInitial_Unit_1_Lab_2.ipynb`
2.  Import the numpy and pandas packages.
3.  Generate a DataFrame that contains the data from the dataset you selected from Bootstrap World and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
4.  Using single square brackets, generate a data structure that contains the data from one column in your DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
5.  Display the data structure you just generated as well as its type.
6.  Using double square brackets, generate a data structure that contains the data from the same column in your DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
7.  Display the data structure you just generated as well as its type.
8.  Generate a subDataFrame that contains two columns of Data from your original DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
9.  Display the subDataFrame you just generated as well as its type.
10.  Generate a subDataFrame that contains several columns of Data from your original DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
11.  Display the subDataFrame you just generated as well as its type.
12.  Generate a subDataFrame that contains data from one row in your original DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
13.  Display the DataFrame you just generated as well as its type.
14.  Generate a subDataFrame that contains data from two rows in your original DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
15.  Display the DataFrame you just generated as well as its type.
16.  Generate a subDataFrame that contains data from several rows in your original DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
17.  Display the DataFrame you just generated as well as its type.
18.  Generate a new DataFrame containing all of the original data from your original DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
19.  Change the numerical indices of your DataFrame to intuitive labels.  Consider using one of your columns to accomplish this.
20.  Display your new DataFrame.
21.  Generate a subDataFrame that contains data from one rows in your new DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
22.  Display the DataFrame you just generated as well as its type.
23.  Generate a subDataFrame that contains data from two rows in your new DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
24.  Display the DataFrame you just generated as well as its type.
25.  Generate a subDataFrame that contains data from several rows in your new DataFrame and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
26.  Display the DataFrame you just generated as well as its type.
27.  Generate a subDataFrame that contains data from several rows and several columns in your new DataFrame containing numerical indices and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
28.  Display the DataFrame you just generated as well as its type.
29.  Generate a subDataFrame that contains data from several rows and several columns in your new DataFrame containing labels and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
30.  Display the DataFrame you just generated as well as its type.
31.  Respond to the following prompt...
* In step 4, you generated a data structure using single square brackets.  In step 6, generated a data structure using double square brackets  Explain the difference between using single square brackets vs. double square brackets to select a column from a DataFrame.
* Summarize the different ways to generate subDataFrames (i.e. How can you generate a subDataFrame containing one column? one row? two columns? two rows? several columns? several rows? several columns and several rows?)
* Throughout this lab, you generated several subDataFrames. For each data frame you generated, describe what the data it contained represents in the context of your data.
* Describe the difference between loc and iloc.
  
After you have completed this lab, upload your work to your GitHub > Data Science Portfolio > Labs folder.  **Remember to include an appropriate heading, appropriate comments, and commit message.**
