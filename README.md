**Course Description:** <br><br>Data Science 1 (Fall Semester) is a semester-long course that serves as the 7th of 8 Computer Science courses required for the CTE Computer Science pathway at Inwood Early College. In this course, you will apply what you have learned about Computer Science and the Python programming language as you begin exploring the field of Data Science. This course will introduce you to powerful data visualization, analysis, and manipulation tools such as the numpy, Matplotlib, and pandas libraries. You will also learn how to use Python to solve statistical problems. Successful completion of this course will prepare you for exploration of intermediate and advanced topics in Data Science. In place of an industry credential exam, you will have the opportunity to begin curating your professional Computer Science portfolio.<br><br>Data Science 2 (Spring Semester) is a semester-long course that serves as the 8th of 8 Computer Science courses required for the CTE Computer Science pathway at Inwood Early College. In this course, you will expand your data visualization toolkit using the Seaborn library as well as your Python toolkit using functions, nested functions, lambda functions, iterators, generators, and list comprehension. Successful completion of this course lays the foundation for deeper exploration of Data Science itself as well as related fields such as Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. In place of an industry credential exam, in this course, you will curate and present your professional Computer Science portfolio to a panel of professionals including faculty, industry representatives, and post-secondary representatives.

**Course Outcomes:** Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to...

* Engage in the **design thinking** process to iteratively develop your work.

**Professional Portfolio:** As part of this course, you will begin curating your professional Computer Science portfolio. As you have progressed through your Computer Science coursework, beginning in grade 9, you have had the opportunity to apply your skills by working on a variety of different projects. Your portfolio will serve as a curated sample of the projects you have completed.

**Content** - At minimum, your professional portfolio must include the following:

* **Introduction** – Your introduction serves as the cover page of your portfolio. It should completely, clearly, and concisely provide an overview of your portfolio in a manner that captures the interest of prospective employers and post-secondary institutions.
* **Resume** – Your resume is a document that highlights your education, background experience, skills, and other accomplishments such as certifications, awards, etc. Your resume should be comprehensive, well-formatted, and current.
* **Artifacts of Learning** – The artifacts of learning you include in your portfolio serve as evidence of the technical skills you have developed as a Computer Science major. You may choose to include projects you completed as part of your coursework or projects you have completed on your own based on your coursework. Your portfolio must contain a minimum of four artifacts of learning:
  * One artifact from EITHER Introduction to Information Technology OR Introduction to Web Development.
  * One artifact from EITHER AP Computer Science Principles 1 OR AP Computer Science Principles 2.
  * One artifact from EITHER Python 1 OR Python 2.
  * One artifact from EITHER Data Science 1 OR Data Science 2.
 
**Note:** *The artifacts of learning you include should demonstrate proficiency of the technical skills in the courses they are aligned to.*

* **Reflections** - You must include one reflection for each artifact of learning in your portfolio. The purpose of the reflection is to provide insight about each artifact and how it contributed to your overall learning as a Computer Science major. In crafting each reflection, you should address the following:
  * How would you describe this artifact, and what is its purpose?
  * In what ways did this artifact contribute to your overall learning experience as a Computer Science major?
  * How has this artifact been iteratively developed over time? (include specific examples)
  * Looking back, what might you have done differently?
  * If you were to further develop this artifact, what would your next steps be?   

**Presentation** - Your portfolio should be presented in a web-based format. This may be either a website or a GitHub repository. Additionally, your portfolio should have a well-designed, professional appearance. It should grab the attention of prospective employers and post-secondary institutions. Finally, it should also be easily accessible and easy to navigate.

***Your portfolio will be evaluated by a professional panel consisting of school faculty, industry representatives, and post-secondary representatives.***

**Work-based Learning Requirement:** For this course you are required to complete and log a minimum of 10 work-based learning hours.

**Grading Policy:** Throughout the semester, you will have the opportunity to show what you know through a variety of tasks including, but not limited to: labs, projects, checkpoints, and exams.

Each task will be aligned to one or more course outcomes. You will receive a separate score for each outcome indicating your progress toward mastery of that particular outcome. Your final score for each outcome will be the weighted average of all scores aligned to that particular outcome. Your final grade for the course will be determined using a weighted average of your final outcome scores.

***Note:*** You are NOT expected to demonstrate perfection in this course. You ARE expected to demonstrate **GROWTH!** As such, you will be given many opportunities to reflect on, and revise your work based on the feedback you receive. It is expected that you will take advantage of this opportunity by engaging in the feedback, reflection, revision cycle. ***Students who consistently engage in this process often see significant improvement in their grades.***
