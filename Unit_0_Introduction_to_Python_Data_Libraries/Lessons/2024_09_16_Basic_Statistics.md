### Basic Statistics

**AIM:** How can we leverage the features of NumPy to generate basic statistical measures?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**
<br><ins>IEC.TYS65T.4</ins>: Summarize, analyze, and interpret data.
<br><ins>IEC.TYS65T.6</ins>: Model employability skills such as personal mindset, planning for success, and collaboration.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can use NumPy to determine the mean, median, and standard deviation of a column in a dataframe.
- [ ] I can explain what the mean, median, and standard deviation of data represent in the context of the data.
- [ ] I can determine the correlation coefficient of two columns in a dataframe.
- [ ] I can explain what the correlation coefficient of bivariate data represents in the context of the data.
- [ ] I can make and test a prediction about the relationship between two columns in a dataframe.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br> Describe two datasets that you might expect to be related.  For example, one might expect average daily temperatures and hot chocolate sales to be related because the colder it is the more likely people are to buy hot chocolate.  What datasets can you come up with and why do you think they might be related?
  </tr>
</table>

**AGENDA:**

1. Related Dataset Share Out
2. Predicting Relationships
3. Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation
4. Correlation Coefficient
5. Testing Predictions
6. Check for Understanding

**HOMEWORK:**
