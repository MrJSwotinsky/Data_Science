# Unit 0, Assignment 07: <br> Lab 3 - Basic Statistics
Due: Tuesday, September 17th 2024

In this lab, you will explore how to leverage the features of NumPy to generate some basic statistical measures using the dataset you selected from Bootstrap World.  As you work, be sure to include appropriate comments in your code.

1.  Identify two columns to explore whether or not there is a statistical relationship.  For example, in the Global Waste dataset, one could ask, "Is there a relationship between column J (Municipal Solid Waste per Capita) and column L (Percent Urban)?"  
2.  Create a new Jupyter Notebook file titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Unit_0_Lab_3.ipynb` (Remember to use markdown to include an appropriate heading.)
3.  In markdown, identify...
      * Which columns you have selected.
      * What each column represents.
      * What question you are exploring.  (e.g. in the Global Waste dataset, "Are greater levels of municipal solid waste per capita associated with countries that have a higher percentage of the population living in urban areas?")
      * Your prediction and a rationale for your prediction (e.g. in the Global Waste dataset, one may predict that greater levels of municipal solid waste per capita are associated with countries that have a higher percentage of the population living in urban areas because higher numbers of a concentrated population may result in more waste per person.  Alternatively, one may predict that greater levels of municipal solid waste per capita are associated with countries that have a lower percentage of the population living in urban areas because urban areas may have more efficient systems for reducing waste (e.g. recycling, etc.))
4.  Import the pandas and numpy packages.
5.  Generate a dataframe from your dataset and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
6.  Generate two NumPy arrays (one for each column you selected) and assign each to an appropriately named variable.
7.  Determine the mean, median, and standard deviation of each column you selected and assign each statistical measure to an appropriately named variable.
8.  Display the mean, median, and standard deviation of each column you selected.
9.  Determine the correlation coefficient for the two columns you selected.
10.  Display the correlation coefficient.
11. In a new cell, using markdown, respond to the following prompts:
    * In step 7, you determined the mean, median, and standard deviation of each column.  Explain what each of these mesures means in context of the data.
    * In step 9, you determined the correlation coefficient for the two columns you selected.  What does the correlation coefficient tell you about the relationship between the two columns you selected.  How does this compare to your original prediction.
12.  Upload your work to a your `Labs` folder in your GitHub portfolio.  Remember to include an appropriate commit message.
