## Part 2 - Lab

In this lab, you will explore how to leverage the features of MatPlotLib and PyPlot to generate a histograms using the same columns you selected for Lab 3 from the dataset you selected from Bootstrap World.  As you work, be sure to include appropriate comments in your code.

1.  Create a new Jupyter Notebook file titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Unit_0_Lab_5.ipynb` (Remember to use markdown to include an appropriate heading.)
2.  Import the pandas and NumPy pacakges as well as the PyPlot module from the MatPlotLib package.
3.  Generate a dataframe from your dataset and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
4.  Generate two NumPy arrays (one for each column you selected) and assign each to an appropriately named variable.
5.  For each column, generate a histogram to represent your data.
6.  Generate a new copy of each histogram, but this time select different numbers of bins.
7.  For each column, experiment with different numbers of bins until you find an number of bins that you believe best represents your data.
8.  In a new cell, using markdown, describe the distribution of your data in each column.  
9.  Upload your work to a your `Labs` folder in your GitHub portfolio.  Remember to include an appropriate commit message.
