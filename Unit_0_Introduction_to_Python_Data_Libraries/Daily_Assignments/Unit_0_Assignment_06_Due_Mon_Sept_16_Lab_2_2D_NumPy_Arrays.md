# Unit 0, Assignment 05: <br> Lab 2 - 2D NumPy Arrays
Due: Monday, September 16th 2024

In this lab, you will explore n-dimensional NumPy arrays using the dataset you selected from Bootstrap World.  NumPy arrays can have any number of dimensions.  However, for this lab, you will focus on two-dimensional NumPy arrays.  As you work, be sure to include appropriate comments in your code.

1.  Create a new Jupyter Notebook file titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Unit_0_Lab_2.ipynb` (Remember to use markdown to include an appropriate heading.)
2.  Import the pandas and numpy packages.
3.  Generate a dataframe from your dataset and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
4.  Generate a two-dimensional NumPy array containing the values from your dataframe and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
5.  Display the NumPy array you just generated as well as its type and shape.
6.  Manually generate a 4 x 3 two-dimensional list by selecting a subset of 4 rows and 3 quantitative columns (i.e. columns containing numerical data) from your dataset, and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
7.  Convert your two-dimensional list to a two-dimensional NumPy array and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
8.  Display the NumPy array you just generated as well as its type and shape.
9.  Isolate one row of data from your two-dimensional NumPy array and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
10.  Display the row you just isolated as well as its type and shape.
11.  Isolate a single value from your two-dimensional NumPy array and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
12.  Display the value you just isolated as well as its type.
13.  Isolate a single column of data from your two-dimensional NumPy array and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
14.  Display the column you just isolated as well as its type and shape.
15.  Isolate a 2 x 2 selection of data from your two-dimensional NumPy array and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
16.  Display the 2 x 2 selection you just isolated as well as its type and shape.
17.  Generate a new two-dimensional NumPy array by performing an elementwise operation across your entire NumPy array (e.g. divide every value by 2, increase every value by 10%, etc.), and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
18.  Display the new NumPy array you just generated as well as its type and shape.
19. In a new cell, using markdown, respond to the following prompts:
    * In step 4, you generated and displayed a NumPy array from your dataframe.  When you displayed the NumPy array, what did you notice about the type of each value in the NumPy array.  Explain why this happened.
    * In step 9, you isolated one row from your two-dimensional NumPy array.  What data did the row you isolated represent?  In general, what type of data results from isolating a single row of data from a two-dimensional NumPy array?  What was the first value of the shape and why?
    * In step 11, you isolated one value from your two-dimensional NumPy array.  What data did the value you isolated represent?  In general, what type of data results from isolating a single value of data from a two-dimensional NumPy array?  Try determining the shape of the single value you isolated.  What happens? Explain why.
    * In step 13, you isolated one column from your two-dimensional NumPy array.  What data did the column you isolated represent?  In general, what type of data results from isolating a single column of data from a two-dimensional NumPy array?  What was the second value of the shape and why?
    * In step 15, you isolated a 2 x 2 selection of data from your two-dimension NumPy array.  What did the 2 x 2 selection of data you isolated represent?  In general, what type of data results from isolating a subset of rows and columns from a two-dimension NumPy array?
    * In step 17, you generated a new NumPy array by performing an elementwise operation across all elements of your original NumPy array.  Do the resulting values have any meaning in context of your original data? Explain why or why not.
20.  Upload your work to a your `Labs` folder in your GitHub portfolio.  Remember to include an appropriate commit message.
