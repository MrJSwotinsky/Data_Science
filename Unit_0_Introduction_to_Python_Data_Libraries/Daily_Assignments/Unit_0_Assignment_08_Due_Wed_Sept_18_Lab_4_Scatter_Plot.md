## Part 2 - Lab

In this lab, you will explore how to leverage the features of MatPlotLib and PyPlot to generate a scatter plot using the same columns you selected for Lab 3 from the dataset you selected from Bootstrap World.  As you work, be sure to include appropriate comments in your code.

1.  Create a new Jupyter Notebook file titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Unit_0_Lab_4.ipynb` (Remember to use markdown to include an appropriate heading.)
2.  Import the pandas and NumPy pacakges as well as the PyPlot module from the MatPlotLib package.
3.  Generate a dataframe from your dataset and assign it to an appropriately named variable.
4.  Generate two NumPy arrays (one for each column you selected) and assign each to an appropriately named variable.
5.  Generate and display a line plot to represent your data.
6.  Generate and display a scatter plot to represent your data.
7.  Display the correlation coefficient of your data.
8. In a new cell, using markdown, respond to the following prompts:
    * In step 5, you generated a line plot to represent your data.  In your own words, describe the appearance of your line plot.
    * Explain why your line plot appears the way it does.
    * Under what circumstances is a line plot an appropriate data visualization?
    * In step 6, you generated a scatter plot to represent your data.  In your own words, describe the appearance of your scatter plot.
    * In step 7, you displayed the correlation coefficient of your data.  What type of correlation does your data have? (e.g. positive correlation, negative correlation, no correlation, weak correlation, moderate correlation, strong correlation)
    * Explain how you could determine the correlation from the scatter plot.
    * Explain how you could determine the correlation from the correlation coefficient.
    * In general, describe what it means for data to have...
        * A positive correlation
        * A negative correlation
        * No correlation
        * A weak correlation
        * A moderate correlation
        * A strong correlation.    
12.  Upload your work to a your `Labs` folder in your GitHub portfolio.  Remember to include an appropriate commit message.
