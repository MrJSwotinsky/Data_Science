# How To...Create an Appropriate Heading

### At minimum, a heading should include:
* Your full name.
* The assignment name.
* The date.

**Use markdown to professionally format your heading.**

For example, an appropriate heading for your first Data Science Exploration might look like...

<br>

> ## A. Student - Bootstrap Data Exploration
> Monday, September 9th 2024

<br>

The markdown code to create this heading would look like...

```markdown
## A. Student - Bootstrap Data Exploration
Monday, September 9th 2024
```
